## 🧪 Testing

### Test Flows

1. **Text Query Test:**
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev  # Terminal 1
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # Terminal 2

# Test: Ask "When should I irrigate my wheat in Bengaluru?"
# Expected: JSON response with sources and recommendations
```

2. **Voice Input Test:**
```bash
# Click microphone button and speak
# Expected: Speech transcription and query processing
```

3. **Image Upload Test:**
```bash
# Upload sample image from data_samples/
# Expected: Image uploaded to Supabase, analysis returned
```

4. **Policy Matching Test:**
```bash
# Select state: Karnataka, crop: wheat
# Expected: PM-KISAN and PMFBY schemes displayed
```

5. **Offline Test:**
```bash
# Disconnect network and reload
# Expected: PWA shows cached UI and last results
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors:**
```bash
# Ensure backend CORS_ORIGINS includes frontend URL
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
```

**OpenAI API Fallback:**
```bash
# Backend works without OpenAI key using deterministic responses
# For full functionality, add OPENAI_API_KEY to backend/.env
```

**Supabase Connection:**
```bash
# Verify environment variables are set correctly
# Check Supabase project URL and anon key
# Ensure pgvector extension is enabled
```

## ✨ New Multi-Page UI (React Router v6)

- Home `/` – Hero with voice CTA, quick prompts
- Query `/query` – Text/voice/image query with animated results and sources
- Weather `/weather` – District/state forecasts with irrigation guidance
- Market `/market` – Commodity search, 7-day sparkline and BUY/HOLD/SELL
- Schemes `/schemes` – PM-KISAN/PMFBY matching and Apply links
- Diagnostics `/diagnostics` – Image upload, stubbed results, safety warnings
- Community `/community` – Feed, create post, comments, moderation hint
- Profile `/profile` – Saved queries/alerts placeholders and language note
- Admin `/admin` – Flagged queries with moderation actions (stub)
- About `/about` – Data sources, accessibility, limitations and ethics

### Design System
- Palette: Forest `#2a8f6d` → Leaf `#74c69d` gradient, Accent Sun `#f6a71d`
- Typography: Inter + Noto Sans Devanagari, mobile-first sizes
- Cards: Glass effect with backdrop-blur, rounded-2xl, soft shadows
- Animations: Framer Motion slide/fade + micro hover scale via `AnimatedCard`
- Background: Subtle leaf gradients via `src/styles/backgrounds.css`

### Accessibility
- Keyboard focusable controls, visible focus styles
- `aria-live` announcements for results/status
- Alt text and SVG titles included

## 🧩 How to Run Locally

1. Install deps
```bash
npm install
```
2. Create `.env` in project root (optional but recommended)
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```
3. Start frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Start backend (separate terminal)
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Notes:
- Without `VITE_API_URL`, app runs in demo mode with deterministic fallbacks.
- Without Supabase keys, image upload features show a dev-only banner and gracefully degrade.

## 🎥 Updated Demo Script (30–60s)

1. Home: show hero + voice CTA and quick prompts
2. Query: type a question, submit, show animated ResultCard and sources
3. Market: search "tomato", see sparkline and SELL/HOLD/BUY
4. Schemes: choose state/crop, view at least one scheme and Apply link
5. Diagnostics: upload `sample_leaf_1.jpg`, see progress and safe recommendation
6. Community: create a post; show optimistic render
7. PWA: install prompt and offline reload (last query appears)

## 📸 Screenshots to Capture

- Home hero + quick prompts
- Query with results and sources
- Market with sparkline and signal badge
- Schemes with policy cards and Apply
- Diagnostics with upload progress + warning

## 🗺️ Files Added/Modified

- Components: `Header`, `Footer`, `BottomTabs`, `HeroIllustration`, `AnimatedCard`, `Sparkline`
